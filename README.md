# MATLAB Machine Learning Internship– Graphic Era Deemed to be University

This repository contains all the **MATLAB based Machine Learning projects** completed during my internship at **Graphic Era Deemed to be University** (July 2024 – August 2024).  
The internship focused on applying machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and visualization methods using MATLAB’s computational environment.

## Internship Overview

During this internship, I:

- Implemented core **machine learning algorithms** in MATLAB, including KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, K Means, Decision Trees, and Discriminant Analysis.
- Performed **data preprocessing**, cleaning operations, and exploratory data visualization.
- Built **interactive visualizations** and statistical plots to interpret datasets effectively.
- Worked with MATLAB scripts and functions to understand ML model behavior, dataset distribution, and classification boundaries.
- Gained hands-on experience using MATLAB for academic and real world machine learning tasks.
